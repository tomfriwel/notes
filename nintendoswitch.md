### 换区后的黄金点数

换区后黄金点数不会被清空，但是获取的黄金点数应该是只能在你获取点数的时候的区才能使用，因为我换区后点数是变成各个区的点数，而不是通用的。

建议卡带的黄金点数先不要急着领取，等要买某个区的游戏的时候，换好区再领。

### Error Code: 2124 8028

这种情况一般出现在账号切换区域后，进入eShop需要重新登录的情况。

网络问题，我用移动4G开热点解决。再看看是不是在下载东西。如果连续切换，可能需要断开热点后重新连接一次热点。

### Error Code: 2124-8028
Applies to:  Nintendo Switch
#### Description:
You are unable to sign into your Nintendo Account on Nintendo Switch and receive the error code 2124-8028.

#### Additional Information:
* This error code indicates there was an error when signing in to your Nintendo Account, such as when performing actions like starting the Nintendo eShop.
* While this error code is related to Nintendo Accounts on Nintendo Switch, it is likely this is due a poor network environment, such as a network with a weak wireless strength or slow Internet speeds.
#### Possible Solutions:
* **Move the Nintendo Switch console closer to the wireless router.**

    * If possible, place the Nintendo Switch within 10 to 15 feet of the wireless router to improve the signal strength during troubleshooting.

It may be helpful to remove the Nintendo Switch console from the Nintendo Switch dock while troubleshooting, and then return the console when troubleshooting is complete.
* **Power cycle your home network.**
Restarting your network devices may resolve this issue if it is related to the devices being unresponsive.

* **Move any metal objects or electronic devices away from your Nintendo Switch console and wireless router.**
Metal objects and electronic devices may interfere with wireless signals. If you have any of these, such as filing cabinets, speakers, power strips, glass, or cordless phones, next to your console or wireless router, move them away.

* **If supported by your router, connect to a different wireless band.**
Many routers support both the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz frequency bands. If your router supports both, set up a new Internet connection and connect to the band you are not currently connecting to. Many routers will have default SSID names that label whether the connection is 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz, but if you're not sure, you can review this information within your router's settings.

#### Situation Not Resolved:
If this issue persists, it may just indicate a temporary issue with your Internet service. Wait a while and try again later.
