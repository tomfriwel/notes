# upgrade

You should consider using the new upgrade tool based on Git. It makes upgrades easier by resolving most conflicts automatically.
To use it:
- Go back to the old version of React Native
- Run "npm install -g react-native-git-upgrade"
- Run "react-native-git-upgrade"
See https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html

My problem has been solved by adding NSAllowsLocalNetworking to Info.plist

<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	<dict>
		<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
		<true/>
		<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent</key>
		<true/>
		<key>NSAllowsLocalNetworking</key>
		<true/>
	</dict>
</key>
I am not sure it is because of RN0.42 or iOS issue, but it is solved in my case.
```

# React Navigation

### navigate to other page:

```
this.props.navigation.navigate('ToPage')
//or with params
this.props.navigation.navigate('ToPage', {
    title:'anything'
})

//get the param inside of ToPage's render()
const { params } = this.props.navigation.state;

<Text>title:{JSON.stringify(params.title)}</Text>
```

### Back to previous page:

```
this.props.navigation.goBack()
```
