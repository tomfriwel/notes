# Phoenix
```
What are you willing to lose

You cover your wounds
but underneath them

A million voices in your head
that whisper "Stop now"

Another twist of the knife turn of the screws

It's all in your mind and it's fighting you

Arm yourself a storm is coming

Well kid

What you gonna do now

It's your reflection looking
back to pull you down

So are you gonna die today
or make it out alive

You gotta conquer the monster in
your head and then you'll fly

Fly Phoenix fly

It's time for a new empire

Go bury your demons then
tear down the ceiling

Phoenix fly

And now you're playing with
matches come out of the ashes

Underneath you a million voices in the
crowd they're screaming "Stop now"

Well let'em swallow their pride you're
turning the tide to true believers

Got them in the palm of your
hand your're playing God now

What you gonna do now

It's your reflection looking
back to pull you down

So are you gonna die today
or make it out alive

You gotta conquer the monster in
your head and then you'll fly

Fly Phoenix fly

It's time for a new empire

Go bury your demons then
tear down the ceiling

Phoenix fly

What you gonna do now

What you gonna do now

So are you gonna die today
or make it out alive

You gotta conquer the monster in
your head and then you'll fly

Fly Phoenix fly

It's time for a new empire

Go bury your demons then
tear down the ceiling

Phoenix fly
